    What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a way for two software systems to communicate with each other.

In simple terms, an API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications 
to communicate and exchange data with each other.
It acts as an intermediary or messenger between two software components.


How APIs Work (The Request-Response Cycle)
APIs typically work through a client-server model using a request-response cycle:

# Client sends a Request: One application (the client) initiates an action by sending a request to another application (the server). 
This request is structured according to the API's rules (protocols).

# API Acts as Messenger: The API receives the request, delivers it to the server, 
and specifies what is needed (e.g., retrieving data, placing an order, or logging a user in).

# Server Processes: The server processes the request and retrieves the necessary information or performs the required function.

# Server sends a Response: The server sends a response back to the client, again structured according to the API's rules. 
This response contains the requested data or a status code (like a successful status or an error message).


# Common Examples of APIs
1. Weather Apps: Your phone's weather app uses a weather service's API to request and display current weather data. displayed in JSON format.

2. Logging In with Google/Facebook: When you click "Login with Google" on a third-party website, 
that website is using the Google API to securely verify your identity without ever seeing your password.

3. Online Shopping: When you check out and select "Pay with PayPal," 
the e-commerce site uses the PayPal API to process the payment without directly accessing your sensitive bank details.

#Purpose and Benefits of APIs
1. The main purpose of an API is to simplify software development by enabling:

2. Integration: Easily connecting new applications with existing systems.

3. Reusability: Developers don't have to build every feature from scratch; they can leverage existing functionality and data offered by other services.

4. Security and Abstraction: The API hides the internal details of the server, only exposing the necessary functions, which adds a layer of security and makes the system easier to maintain.

<!-- What is a REST API?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer ‚Äî it‚Äôs a style of building APIs that use HTTP methods like: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

In simple terms, a REST API is a set of rules and guidelines that allow different computer systems to communicate with each other over the internet, 
typically using the HTTP protocol. 

# CRUD Operations in REST APIs
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete ‚Äî the four basic operations you can perform on data.
Create data: POST
Read data: GET
Update data: PUT
Delete data: DELETE
-->

<!-- How a REST API Works (Using HTTP Methods)
REST APIs primarily use standard HTTP methods (also called verbs) to perform operations on the resources. 
This maps directly to the common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:

HTTP Method	CRUD Operation	Purpose	Example
GET	Read	Retrieves a representation of a resource or a collection of resources.	GET /api/users (Get all users)
POST	Create	Creates a new resource. The data for the new resource is included in the request body.	POST /api/users (Create a new user)
PUT	Update	Replaces an existing resource entirely with the new data in the request body.	PUT /api/users/123 (Replace user 123)
PATCH	Update	Applies partial modifications to a resource.	PATCH /api/users/123 (Update only the email for user 123)
DELETE	Delete	Removes a specific resource.	DELETE /api/users/123 (Delete user 123)


The Six Architectural Constraints (Principles)
For an API to be considered truly "RESTful," it should adhere to the following six constraints:

Client-Server Decoupling: The client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) and the server must be completely separate and independent of each other. 
This allows each side to evolve independently.

Statelessness: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request. 
The server cannot rely on any session state stored on the server from previous requests.

Cacheable: Responses must explicitly or implicitly label themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
This allows the client or an intermediary to store responses to reuse them for later, equivalent requests, which improves performance and scalability.

Uniform Interface: This is the most critical constraint. It simplifies the entire system architecture by providing a consistent way 
for clients to interact with all resources. It is achieved through:

Resource Identification in Requests (using URIs/URLs).

Manipulation of Resources Through Representations (e.g., using JSON data).

Self-Descriptive Messages (using standard HTTP headers and status codes).

Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) (where the server includes links in the response to guide the client on 
available next actions‚Äîthough this is often the most relaxed constraint in "RESTful" APIs today).

Layered System: A client should not be able to tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary like a load balancer,
 proxy, or gateway. This allows for increased scalability and security.

Code on Demand (Optional): The server can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code 
(e.g., Java applets or scripts). This is the only optional constraint. -->

How to Call an API Using JavaScript

We use the built-in fetch() function to make API calls in JavaScript.

Here‚Äôs a simple example using the Dog API: -->


  <h1>üêæ Random Dog Generator</h1>
  <button id="getDog">Get Dog</button>
  <br>
  <img id="dogImage" src="https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random" alt="Random Dog">





  <script>
    const btn = document.getElementById('getDog');
    const dogImage = document.getElementById('dogImage');

    btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
      fetch('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random', { method: 'GET' })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          dogImage.src = data.message;
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    });
  </script>
    
</body>
