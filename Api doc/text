What is an api:
An api is an application programming interface
A request has two paths

What is REST?:

What is Fastapi: It is a library that help us to write rest apis and all we need is to 
do is to write what the api does with a request and how it responds to it

How to create virtual environment

Step 1: Install pipenv and add to path (https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)
pip install pipenv

Step 2: Install fastapi in our virtual environment
pipenv install fastapi
("pipenv --venv" to view virtual environment)      

Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment
pipenv shell


how to create virtual environment

The best and most standard way to create a Python virtual environment is using the built-in venv module. This ensures your project has its own isolated set of Python packages, preventing conflicts with other projects or your global system environment.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt
Navigate to the root directory of your project where you want the virtual environment to live.

Bash

cd path/to/your/project
2. Create the Virtual Environment
Use the python -m venv command followed by the name you want to give the environment. The most common convention is to name it .venv or venv.

Bash

# Recommended command:
python -m venv .venv
python (or python3): Executes your Python interpreter.

-m venv: Tells Python to run the venv module.

.venv: The name of the folder that will be created to hold your isolated environment files.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
After creation, you must activate the environment to start using it. The command differs slightly depending on your operating system:

‚öôÔ∏è Windows (Command Prompt)
Bash

.venv\Scripts\activate
üíª Windows (PowerShell)
Bash

.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
üêß macOS / Linux
Bash

source .venv/bin/activate
Verification
Once activated, you will see the environment's name (e.g., (.venv)) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

Bash

# Example of an activated prompt:
(.venv) $ path/to/your/project
4. Install Packages
While the environment is active, any packages you install will only exist inside this isolated project environment.

Bash

# Example: Install a package
pip install requests
5. Deactivate the Environment
When you are done working in the project, simply use the deactivate command to return to your global system environment.

Bash

deactivate
